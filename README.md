# Really Simple One Time Passcode Input
This is a simple one time passcode input for your React Native App. I made this because I couldn't find a simple one that suited my needs. I wanted a simple one that I could just drop in and use without having to worry about styling or anything else. This is my first React Native component so please let me know if there are any issues or if you have any suggestions.
